                                <p class="card-text"><p>Born and raised in Houston Texas on January 4th with my mother and two younger brothers, Andrew (25 years old) and David (22 years old) who have recently moved to Austin. As a kin in elementary school i was introduced to computers early, in first grade to be exact, and we had classes to learn to type faster, email one another, and eventually buy and trade stocks using "yahoo stocks kids". Around 3rd grade I enjoyed typing away on a keyboard so much so that I ended up assisting the elementary school computer teacher to set up and install the software on the <em>"newest"</em> computers at the time (the colored macintosh desktops) throughout the school campus. In middle school i found some of my closest group of friends, who i still see and talk to regularly, and ended up getting very into an online game called "NeoPets". This was my introduction to basic HTML. We formed a Guild, and edited the html of that guild page to be styled the way we liked, and even shared the administration on the page in order to easily post answers to homework assignments to share amongst ourselves. For my 4 years of high school, I was in the IB (International Baccalaureate) program as well as a member, and an eventual officer in the JROTC program. I comptitively shot olympic grade air riffles within the Houston district and placed 3rd in all of HISD my senior year. I also took a few years learning Japanese, and took a class on basic javascript. After graduation I went to Baylor University in Waco Texas to get a degree in Biology with an emphasis on premedicial school and a minor in Forensic Science. Halfway through my  4 years in college I realized i dont actually want to be a docotor, but very much enjoyed the scientific aspects of forensics and just working in a lab environment. I also contemplated changing majors all together and being a Computer Science major, but was detered because i didnt want to do the paperwork to change majors or to transfer to a different university, so i graduated with a degree in biology.</p>
                                <p> Post graduation I started to work for a company in Alvin Texas, right outside of Houston, called Rice Technologies. Here i got to very much be emersed in the lab experience extracting DNA from rice seads and grass, testing them against different probes for distinct genetic markers, and in some cases I would even test the quality of rice such as solubility, clarity, and quality of the grains. Rice Tech is a company that produces rice that is not genetically modified, sold in stores as "Rice Select", and crossbreeds their rice for variation and specificity of traits needed to grow in several different regions that specific rice breeds grow in. After working there for a year and a half, I moved to Austin on January 2nd of 2015 to come work for a biological manufacturing company called Agilent, where I am currently emplyed. Agilent manufactures instuments and biological materials used primarily for reserch and diagnostic purposes, a lot of which is involved in the detections of different cancers. Currently i work in the department that produces large volumes of biological solutions, up to 2000 Liters, that are used for several different types of tests sold to universitys, medical field, and private comapnies. Our branch in the Austin area is relatively small, only about 180 employees, and feels very secluded sitting right outside of Bastrop next to McKinney Roughs.</p>
                                <p> In my spare time Im usually hanging out with my brothers, one of my two friends that live in Austin as well that i have known since i was a small kid, or my close coworkers who i regularly play DND with. I have 3 cats, 2 black (Nero and Atlas) and 1 white that i spoil rotten. I love to draw and paint when im in the mood to do so, and regularly knit and crochet new things when i find a really interesting pattern. I listen to several podcasts throughout the day mostly involving true crime, the supernatural, dnd real play, and comedy. I attend occasional live music events, and regularly play a could different PS4 and PC games from time to time. My favorite book generes are horror, true crime, science fiction, and graphic novels. Favorite film/tv generes are true crime, documentaries, comedy, british humor, science fiction, horror, supernatural, cooking and baking shows and competitions, and occasional action movies. I also enjoy cooking from time to time, mostly baking baked goods from puff pasty cream horns to fresh carrot cake all the way to tamales and dumplings from scratch. </p>
                                <p> Im excited to learn more coding languages and being able to manipulate web pages better than i have in the past and utilize my new skills to change careers and possibly even brigde the gap between both skill sets.</p></p>
